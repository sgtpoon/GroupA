# A unit test for the socket object creation and connection component of the client-side #code:
import unittest
import socket


class TestSocketConnection(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_socket_creation(self):
        # Create a socket object
        client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

        # Assert that the socket object is not None
        self.assertIsNotNone(client_socket)

    def test_socket_connection(self):
        # Create a socket object
        client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

        # Get local machine name
        host = socket.gethostname()

        # Set port number
        port = 12345

        # Connect to the server
        client_socket.connect((host, port))

        # Assert that the connection was successful
        self.assertTrue(client_socket)

        # Close the socket
        client_socket.close()

'''In this example, we have created a `TestSocketConnection` class that inherits from the `unittest.TestCase` class.This class defines two test methods - `test_socket_creation()` and `test_socket_connection()`.
The `test_socket_creation()` method tests whether the socket object is created successfully.It creates a socket object and asserts
that the socket object is not None. The `test_socket_connection()` method tests whether the socket object successfully connects
to the server.It creates a socket object, sets the host and port number, and connects to the server.It then asserts that
the connection was successful by checking that the socket object is not None.Finally, it closes the socket. You can run these
unit tests using the `unittest` module in Python.Here's an example of how you can run the unit tests:
python if __name__ == '__main__' unittest.main(). When you run the above code, the unit tests will run and the results will be displayed in the
command prompt.If the tests pass, you will see a message indicating that all
tests have passed.If the tests fail, you will see an error message indicatin which test(s)
failed and why. 
Note: This is just an example of a test for the socket object creation and connection component.You may need to modify this code to suit your specific needs and test other components of the program as well.’’’
